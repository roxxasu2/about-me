<p style="text-align: right; color: #FFB6C1;"> Thank you for reading the whole thing!! If you did though, <br> but if you didn't then that's okay!!!! I so understand that it took so long to read it all, <br> but I had promised to make it have every inch of my information besides my face.<br> Also, I hope you learned alot about me!!<br> I might've not added some of my information that I didn't notice so <br> I might just mention it to you if you <br> ever have any questions. Also, I'm so thankful to my dearest teacher Ms. Jane for teaching me how to code, <br> with that lesson I was able to create a webpage/website that talks about me and my information(besides my private ones) <br></p>

<h1 style="font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, serif; background-color: #FFFFFF; color: #FFB6C1; text-align: Center;"> THAT'S ALL! THANK YOUUU<3333 </h1>
